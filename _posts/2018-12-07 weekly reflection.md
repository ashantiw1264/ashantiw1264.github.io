My flag is the jamaican flag and that flag represent my home and all the things that it stands for so went my teacher which is mrs alatta asks us to pick a flag that stands out i picked the jamaican flag.
My flag symbolism of the colours is: yellow, sunshine and natural resources; black, the burdens borne by the people; green, agriculture and hope for the future. "Burdens and hardships there may be, but we have hope and the sun still shines". Which i got from a website called the fotw.info which is a good website to use soâ€¦.
The Flag has a diagonal cross or saltire with four triangles in juxtaposition. The diagonal cross is in gold and one-sixth of the length of the fly of the flag; the top and bottom triangles are in green; and the hoist and fly triangles are in black. The exact shade of green used in the flag is Emerald T8 17, British Admiralty Bunting Pattern. The Flag follows the proportion is 2 x 1.
So this week we have been designing flags and by next week in my next reflection i will be finished with my flag and all the shapes will be placed in so until next week you guys can go on fotw.info and get to know more about your flag.
